This repository follows the Godot "Dodge the Creeps" tutorial, in Rust using the [godot-rust](https://godot-rust.github.io/) crate. The Godot project lives in [godot/](godot) and the Rust sources in [rust/](rust).

**How to Run**
1. Open the project in Godot by selecting [godot/project.godot](godot/project.godot).
2. Build the Rust code before running anything in Godot:

```bash
cd rust
cargo build
```

3. In Godot, run the main scene.
